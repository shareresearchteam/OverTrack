ROITrackerFullFrames is the most basic version of the tracker
ROITrackerThreadedFrames is the same as FullFrames, but it processes the video in a separate thread to increase speed
ROITrackerSelectFrames can take a frame every N seconds, this was deemed not useful due to issues with tracker accuracy caused by missing frames
